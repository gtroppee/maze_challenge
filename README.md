# Challenge

### Maze solving through Breadth-first search (BFS)

#### **Rules**

- We must compute our way from a source value to a target value
- We can only use 1 of these 3 operation types to go from one step to the next : +2, *2 and /2
- We must print out the quickest ways to solve the maze

### Testing
Just launch the RSpec command
```ruby
rspec
```
